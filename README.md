# RymeTest

Question 4

Describe how you would produce a version with another language of the program that could be translated by a non-technical external translation agency (donâ€™t have to code this, just give a high level overview of how you would approach it).


I will have language class which i will pass the ryme string through it and the along country code. the country code, the ryme transation will be saved in a file of database. so when i pass the ryme through the class, it will pick the translation from the file using the country code. and then return the translated version of the ryme.
